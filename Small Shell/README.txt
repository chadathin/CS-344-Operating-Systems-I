Welcome to my smallsh portfolio project!

To compile, simply run the following command: gcc smallsh.c -o smallsh

Then, to run, simply type: ./smallsh

You will be presented with a colon (:) for a prompt.

Here, you can enter commands and arguments to be forked and exec'ed.

You may enter and exit foreground-only mode using Ctrl+Z.

This shell supports custom cd, status and exit commands.

Thank you!
